The Free plan gives you access to basic grammar maps and limited exercises. Premium includes all language features, unlimited practice exercises, progress tracking, and personalized learning paths.

    },
    {
      id: 3,
      category: "account",
      question: "How do I change my password?",
      answer: "To change your password, log into your account and go to Settings > Security. Click on 'Change Password' and follow the prompts. You'll need to enter your current password once and your new password twice to confirm."
    },
    {
      id: 4,

    },
    {
      id: 5,
      category: "features",
      question: "What makes SyntaxMap different from other language learning apps?",
      answer: "SyntaxMap focuses specifically on making grammar visual and intuitive. Unlike many language apps that teach phrases by repetition, we use interactive visual maps to show how different tenses and grammatical features connect to each other. This approach helps learners understand the underlying structure of language, making it easier to form correct sentences intuitively."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      category: "features",
      question: "Which languages are supported?",
      answer: "Currently, SyntaxMap focuses on English grammar, with comprehensive coverage of all tenses, conditionals, and grammatical structures. We're actively developing Spanish, French, and German modules, which should be available by the end of 2025. Our roadmap includes expanding to 8 languages by 2027."
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      category: "features",
      question: "How do I track my progress?",
      answer: "Premium users can access detailed progress tracking through the Dashboard. You can view your learning streak, mastery level for different grammar concepts, accuracy rates, and personalized recommendations for improvement. The system automatically identifies areas where you struggle and suggests targeted exercises."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      category: "technical",
      question: "Can I use SyntaxMap offline?",
      answer: "Yes, our mobile apps for iOS and Android support offline mode. You can download specific grammar modules and practice exercises to use without an internet connection. Your progress will sync with our servers the next time you're online."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      category: "technical",
      question: "Which browsers and devices are supported?",
      answer: "SyntaxMap works on all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We have native apps for iOS and Android devices. The platform is responsive and works on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. For optimal experience, we recommend using the latest version of your browser or our mobile apps."
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      category: "technical",
      question: "What should I do if I encounter a bug?",
      answer: "If you encounter any issues, please report them through Settings > Report a Bug or email our support team at support@syntaxmap.com. Include details about what you were doing when the issue occurred, your device, browser, and any error messages you received. Screenshots are also helpful. Our team typically addresses critical bugs within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      category: "learning",
      question: "How much time should I spend practicing each day?",
      answer: "We recommend at least 15-20 minutes of practice daily for steady progress. Consistency is more important than session length â€“ regular short sessions are more effective than occasional long ones. Our system is designed to optimize learning in short bursts, with each exercise session targeting specific grammar concepts."
    },
    {
      id: 12,
      category: "learning",
      question: "Can I reset my progress for a specific module?",
      answer: "Yes, you can reset progress for individual grammar modules. Go to the module you want to reset, click the three dots in the top right corner, and select 'Reset Progress'. This will clear your completion status and mastery level for that module only, allowing you to start fresh."
    },
    {
      id: 13,
      category: "learning",
      question: "Do you offer certificates for completed courses?",
      answer: "Yes, Premium users receive completion certificates for each major grammar section they master. These certificates can be downloaded as PDFs and include details about the specific grammar concepts you've mastered. While not formally accredited, many students include these certificates in language learning portfolios."
    },
    {
      id: 14,
